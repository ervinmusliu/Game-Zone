                <p class="em-text">A petition urging Electronic Arts to refund dissatisfied
                    Battlefield 2042 players is rapidly gaining support from the game's community.
                    <br>Electronic Arts’ long-running Battlefield franchise seems to have hit a low
                    point; Battlefield 2042, the latest installment in the series, was met with a
                    considerable amount of backlash from fans when it debuted in November of 2021.
                    Citing a litany of bugs, a concerning dearth of features, and an overall lack
                    of polish, many gamers urged the publisher to refund dissatisfied consumers,
                    and a petition asserting that very sentiment about Battlefield 2042 recently passed 200,000 signatures.</p>
                <p class="em-text">When it was first revealed during E3 2021, Battlefield 2042 
                    looked to be the next evolution in multiplayer FPS gameplay. Ditching the 
                    historical settings of Battlefield 1 and Battlefield 5, EA and DICE’s new
                    Battlefield installment recalled shades of the massive modern military conflicts
                    seen in Battlefield 3 and Battlefield 4. Unfortunately, though it did return
                    aspects of those games to the series via the new Portal mode, Battlefield 2042
                    was substantially rougher around the edges when compared to previous entries.</p>
                <p class="em-text">Though DICE has issued a series of bug fixes and patches in the 
                    months since Battlefield 2042's launch, the thousands of gamers who have signed
                    the petition aren’t likely to be swayed by minor updates. Alleging that both the
                    publisher and developer did not meet pre-launch promises and that the game is “unplayable,”
                    the strongly-worded stance of petition creator Satoshi Nakamoto—an alias borrowed from the
                    supposed creator of Bitcoin—doesn’t leave much room for negotiation.</p>

                <h2 class="em-title">microsoft buys activision for $68.7 billion</h2>
                <p class="em-text">Microsoft plans to acquire Activision Blizzard, publisher of some
                    of the most popular games on the planet (from World of Warcraft to Call of Duty),
                    as well as the studios currently embroiled in multiple lawsuits related to accusations
                    of gender discrimination in its workplace, the company announced Tuesday. Xbox boss
                    Phil Spencer will serve as the CEO of Microsoft Gaming and oversee Activision
                    Blizzard once the transaction is finalized.</p>
                <p class="em-text">The deal is worth $68.7 billion, Microsoft said, the largest acquisition in the company’s history.<br>
                    In a blog post about the acquisition, Spencer said that Microsoft “will offer as many Activision Blizzard games as
                     we can within Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass, both new titles and games from Activision Blizzard’s incredible catalog.”</p>
                <p class="em-text">As far as the discrimination lawsuits, Spencer’s blog post and the announcement post from Microsoft made no
                    direct mention of the situation. However, Spencer’s post includes this paragraph about workplace culture: “As a company, Microsoft
                    is committed to our journey for inclusion in every aspect of gaming, among both employees and players. We deeply value individual
                    studio cultures. We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect.
                    We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment.”</p>

                <h2 class="em-title">rockstar games confirm the new gta game is under development</h2>
                <p class="em-text">Rockstar Games has officially confirmed that the next Grand Theft Auto game
                    is in development. It's not just getting started, either, as Rockstar said in a blog post 
                    that the new project is "well underway." Whether or not the new game is called GTA 6 or something
                    else remains to be seen.<br>The studio did not reveal any specifics about the new game, which is
                    rumored to have a Fortnite-style evolving map. Presumably the new game is being developed by multiple
                    Rockstar studios, as the company has done for some of its biggest releases, like Red Dead Redemption II most recently.</p>
                <p class="em-text">While Rockstar isn't ready just yet to divulge specifics on the next GTA, the company 
                    said its general philosophy with new games is to "significantly move beyond" what it achieved before.<br>
                    "With the unprecedented longevity of GTA V, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in 
                    the Grand Theft Auto series. With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move 
                    beyond what we have previously delivered--and we are pleased to confirm that active development for the next
                    entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway," Rockstar said. "We look forward to sharing more as soon
                    as we are ready..."</p>
                <p class="em-text">It is no surprise that Rockstar is making a new GTA, as it's been reported for a
                    long time already that the studio was building the next game. The fact that GTA V and GTA Online 
                    continue to perform so well so late in their lifecycles (the base game has sold 155 million copies) has
                    made some believe the next proper entry wouldn't be released in the near future. The game will be released
                    on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in March, while a standalone edition of GTA Online is also launching then.<br>
                    As for when the next GTA might be released, we don't know, and Rockstar, as well as parent company Take-Two,
                    have given no firm indication. However, some analysts believe it could release as soon as 2023.</p>
